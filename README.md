## Description

🔥 In this project i re-built the google search page and its functionality
within the input search field. I created an suggestions array with strings
and on user input, user gets a search suggestions box based on the letter
he is typing in.

⚠️ Suggest-Array is ['Javascript', 'Javascript lernen', 'Javascript array']


## Stack & Decisions

+ Semantic HTML Markup <br />
+ Vanilla JavaScript <br />
+ Modern Vanilla CSS (Nested) <br />
+ Defered JS implementations <br />
+ Waiting for DOMContentLoaded <br />
